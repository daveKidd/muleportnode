# Dave Kidd's MuleSoft Node/Express Technical Exercise

--Hello!  I wanted to create the API from the technical project using Node and Express  

--Knex runs the MySQL (on Heroku) and SQLite (locally) queries to retrieve the American Airlines flights

--The node-fetch package was used to get the JSON data for United  

--Middleware was used to make sure the destinations were correct

--Routes were used to handle the American Airlines and United get requests

--Locally, the project uses migrations and seeds to create a SQLite database identical to the online version that we can retrieve the American Airlines flights from

--When deployed to Heroku, it uses the live MySQL Database given in the instructions

--I enjoyed creating this, thanks for taking a look, and I hope we can be in touch soon!
